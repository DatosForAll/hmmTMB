#' Hidden Markov model data class
#'
#' @description Encapsulates data observing one or more time series.
#' Object can be created using $new with arguments:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item data: a data frame with at least one column of observations. A column called "time" can be
#'   given for the time of each observation, otherwise assumed observations are regular in time.
#' }
#'
#' Methods include:
#' \itemize{
#'  \item
#' }
#'
