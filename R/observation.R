#' Hidden Markov observation class
#'
#' @description Encapsulates the observation model from a hidden Markov model.
#' Object can be created using $new with arguments:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item data: a HmmData object
#'   \item obsnames: columns names of data streams that are observations
#'   \item dists: distributions for each data stream
#' }
#'
#' Methods include:
#' \itemize{
#'  \item  NA
#' }
#'
