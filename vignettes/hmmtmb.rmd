# Observation distributions

Distributions for the observation process are created using the Dist class. To define a new distribution, we provide its name (as a string), its probability density/mass function (as a function), and the link functions for its parameters (as named lists of functions). For example, for the normal distribution, we have
```{r dist-def}
dist_norm <- Dist$new(name = "normal", pdf = dnorm,
                      link = list(mean = identity, sd = log),
                      invlink = list(mean = identity, sd = exp))
```

The functions n2w and w2n transform parameters of the observation distributions from the natural to the working scale and vice-versa. We can verify that applying the two functions successively returns the original parameter values:
```{r norm-test}
# List of parameters (on the natural scale)
par1 <- list(mean = c(0, 5), sd = c(1, 10))

# Transform to working scale
wpar <- dist_norm$n2w(par1)
wpar

# Transform back to natural scale
par2 <- dist_norm$w2n(wpar)
par2
```

# HMM data

Data objects are defined with the HmmData class. An object can be created from a data frame which includes one column for each observed variable and for each covariate. There are special column names: "ID" is used to identify the time series if several are provided, and "time" gives the times of observation. If the times of observations are provided, gaps are automatically filled with NAs to create a obtain a regular time grid.

```{r create-data}
# Create a dummy data set, with two time series
times1 <- seq(as.POSIXct("2020/01/01 00:00:00"), by = "hour", length = 10)
times2 <- seq(as.POSIXct("2020/02/01 00:00:00"), by = "hour", length = 10)
data <- data.frame(ID = rep(c(1, 2), each = 10),
                   x = rnorm(20), 
                   time = c(times1, times2))

# Remove a few rows to create gaps in the data
data <- data[-c(2:3, 7, 15:18),]

# Define HmmData object
data_prep <- HmmData$new(data = data, interval = "hour")

# The gaps have been filled
data_prep$data()
```

# HMM observation model

The class Observation encapsulates the model for the observed variables.

```{r obs-create}
# Create a dummy data set
times <- seq(as.POSIXct("2020/01/01 00:00:00"), by = "hour", length = 100)
data <- data.frame(ID = rep(1, 100),
                   x = rnorm(100), 
                   time = times)
data_prep <- HmmData$new(data = data)

# List of observation distributions
dists <- list(x = dist_norm)

# List of observation parameters
par <- list(x = list(mean = 0, sd = 1))

# Create observation process object
obs_process <- Observation$new(data = data_prep, dists = dists, par = par)
```

The parameters on the working scale are calculated when the object is created:
```{r obs-tpar}
obs_process$tpar()
```

The function plot_dist generates a histogram of the observations with the probability density (or mass) function of the specified distribution.
```{r obs-plot}
# Plot histogram and pdf for variable "x"
obs_process$plot_dist(name = "x")
```
